<h1>Dieter Rams: 10 Principles for Good Design</h1>
<h2>Good design is innovative</h2>
I agree with this statement because new forms of design are always coming along due to new forms of technology and changes in the world around us. And designers need to become innovative with their designs in order to stand out, create a brand for themselves and to make new changes to the design world today. This is something that I want to strive for in my design—being innovative and trying out new ideas and not conforming to always just sticking with what “works” or something that i've seen before.

<h2>Good design makes a product useful</h2>
I also agree with this statement because one of the main purposes of design is to guide and aid in product usage; they want to help make a product experience better and easier for the consumer, not harder. This is something i'd like to strive for in my future work.

<h2>Good design is aesthetic</h2>
Aesthetic itself and what each person may like in terms of design and art will always be subjective to the individual themself, but I do think it is an important factor to consider when it comes to design. A designer always wants to make a product useful and create a wonderful experience for the consumer and/or client, however, aesthetics will be something that are always a necessity because while usefulness is important, they also want it to look pleasing and cohesive. I think this is also something I always consider when it comes to my design—how will the end product look? Will it look cohesive?

<h2>Good design makes a product understandable</h2>
I agree with this statement and I think think that it is something important to consider when it comes to product design. While coming up with a product design is important, it should also be considered that when designing, that the design helps in product usefulness and it makes a product easy and practical to use because while a certain design may be intriguing and interesting to look it, it is also important to note whether it’s actually making the product easier to understand or whether it is unnecessary. 

<h2>Good design is unobtrusive</h2>
I agree with this statement to a certain degree, while I think that sometimes it may be best to remain restrained when it comes to design, I wouldn’t say that it is something that should be done for every type of design because then there wouldn’t be much design at all. While this idea of leaving room for the user’s self expression is important, I think that it is also important for the designer to sometimes take the lead and incorporate certain of their own ideas when it comes to certain designs. 

<h2>Good design is honest</h2>
This is another statement that I agree with to a certain extent. While I believe that it is immoral to lie to a consumer and create promises that won’t be kept which is something that I don't plan to do as a designer. I also do not believe in this idea of not making a product more innovative, powerful or valuable because it is in a way a designers job to push boundaries when it comes to designing products or ideas. Then again, it is also up to the designers themselves to decide when it’s too far and when they should stop. 

<h2>Good design is long-lasting</h2>
I agree with this statement because I feel like it Is always something to note if a design has remained long lasting and remains a stable piece of the design industry and world. I also believe that this idea of long lasting doesn’t always need to mean “not fashionable” because sometimes it is through those “fashionable” designs that something even greater is made or something innovative is created—and that type of design is the reason for it henceforth making it long lasting. I would love to create designs in the future that aim to be long lasting and hope to create an impact with them.

<h2>Good design is thorough down to the last detail</h2>
I agree with this statement because when it comes to design, it is especially important to be precise and concise in how you design. Being off, even if by a little will always be something that people will point out first in comparison to something that has been done extremely well. This is why tools like grids and alignment are almost always something that is used when it comes to design because precision can be key in many instances when it comes to making a design. This is something that I aim for in my designs even now, always trying to be thorough and make sure that everything is precise.

<h2>Good design is environmentally-friendly</h2>
I think this is always something to consider when it comes to design because creating something that is environmentally friendly is always something helpful especially in the world we live in today. Climate change is something that is occurring in the world around us and we are always seeing just how much pollution we create therefore being environmentally friendly is always something to keep in mind whether it be through making something that only is seen online or something that can be easily recycled depending on the product—and hopefully something i'd like to incorporate in future designs.

<h2>Good design is as little design as possible</h2>
This idea of simplicity and less is more can be very effective when it comes to certain designs, however, at the same time I also believe that this only works to a certain extent and would depend on the product or project itself. While being minimal can be a great way of designing, it also is not for everyone and doesn’t fit everyone’s design styles. Using as little design as possible can also be quite difficult because it would also mean that everything one would make would need to be perfect because there is no room for imperfection when it comes to minimalism. Minimal design at the same time can make it also very difficult to become innovative because it relies on being simplistic as opposed to trying new ideas and pushing boundaries in a way.
